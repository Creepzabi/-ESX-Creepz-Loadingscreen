This is a Random Script from a random dude from Discord, just a little bit upgraded
To Install it put it in Resources folder in your Server Directory (Unzipped)
then go to Server.cfg and type start loadingscreen 
you can customize it in the config.js and the index.html (\Loadingscreen\html)
the pictures like the server picture in loading screen are in \Loadingscreen\html\assets, feel free to change it
i hope you like it
its a beta btw, its not 100% done but usable
